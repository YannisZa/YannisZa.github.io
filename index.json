Well, there are many answers to that question. A particularly robust one involves treating the model parameters as random variables, also known as a Bayesian treatment of the model.\nIn my first 8-week mini-project in Cambridge I attempted to do just that; introduce an approach in hydrology that incorporates domain expertise from hydrological models and data into a unified (hybrid) modelling framework. The Bayesian nature of the framework meant that one can quantify the uncertainty in model parameters and propagate it all the way to model predictions of water discharge.\nIn the paragraphs below, I briefly go through the methodology and key findings of the study.
