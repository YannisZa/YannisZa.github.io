  abstract = {There is increasing interest to work with user generated content in social media, especially textual posts over time. Currently there is no consistent way of segmenting user posts into timelines in a meaningful way that improves the quality and cost of manual annotation. Here we propose a set of methods for segmenting longitudinal user posts into timelines likely to contain interesting moments of change in a user's behaviour, based on their online posting activity. We also propose a novel framework for evaluating timelines and show its applicability in the context of two different social media datasets. Finally, we present a discussion of the linguistic content of highly ranked timelines.},

  abstract = {In agent-based simulations, synthetic populations of agents are commonly used to represent the structure, behaviour, and interactions of individuals. However, generating a synthetic population that accurately reflects real population statistics is a challenging task, particularly when performed at scale. In this paper, we propose a multi objective combinatorial optimisation technique for large scale population synthesis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by generating a synthetic population for selected regions and validating it on contingency tables from real population data. Our approach supports complex hierarchical structures between individuals and households, is scalable to large populations and achieves minimal contigency table reconstruction error. Hence, it provides a useful tool for policymakers and researchers for simulating the dynamics of complex populations.},

  abstract = {A key challenge in agent-based mobility simulations is the synthesis of individual agent socioeconomic profiles. Such profiles include locations of agent activities, which dictate the quality of the simulated travel patterns. These locations are typically represented in origin-destination matrices that are sampled using coarse travel surveys. This is because fine-grained trip profiles are scarce and fragmented due to privacy and cost reasons. The discrepancy between data and sampling resolutions renders agent traits nonidentifiable due to the combinatorial space of data-consistent individual attributes. This problem is pertinent to any agent-based inference setting where the latent state is discrete. Existing approaches have used continuous relaxations of the underlying location assignments and subsequent ad hoc discretisation thereof. We propose a framework to efficiently navigate this space offering improved reconstruction and coverage as well as linear-time sampling of the ground truth origin-destination table. This allows us to avoid factorially growing rejection rates and poor summary statistic consistency inherent in discrete choice modelling. We achieve this by introducing joint sampling schemes for the continuous intensity and discrete table of agent trips, as well as Markov bases that can efficiently traverse this combinatorial space subject to summary statistic constraints. Our framework's benefits are demonstrated in multiple controlled experiments and a large-scale application to agent work trip reconstruction in Cambridge, UK.},
