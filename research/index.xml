      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does a hydrologist do when they want to estimate the rate of water volume generation and cannot calibrate their parametric model? Well, there are many answers to that question. A particularly robust one involves treating the model parameters as random variables, also known as a &lt;em&gt;Bayesian&lt;/em&gt; treatment of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my first 8-week mini-project in Cambridge I attempted to do just that; introduce an approach in hydrology that incorporates domain expertise from hydrological models and data into a unified (hybrid) modelling framework. The &lt;em&gt;Bayesian&lt;/em&gt; nature of the framework meant that one can quantify the uncertainty in model parameters and propagate it all the way to model predictions of water discharge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bayesian online changepoint detection of point processes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the information age has taught us anything, it is that things change, and they change fast. Some changes are more obvious than others, which begs the question: how can we be sure that something is really changing and it is not just another trick that noise is playing on us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there is an obvious philosophical take on that question, which however interesting is way beyond my reach. In the world of Statistics and Probability, things are a bit simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to take on the task of answering that question as part of my final year undergraduate thesis, which was supervised by 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr. Theodoros Damoulas.&lt;/a&gt;
 My focus was on developing an Bayesian online changepoint detection framework for discrete data generating processes (point processes).&lt;/p&gt;
